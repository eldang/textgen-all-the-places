1. Native acknowledgement
	Place names:
		What's now the Montlake Cut: sxWátSadweehL "Carry a Canoe"
		What's now University Village: shLoowééhL "Little Canoe Hole"
2. Native place names as descriptors: appearance, natural resource, or thing that was done there.
	Settler placename typology:
		* old country (Kent, Newcastle)
		* settler (Redmond, Kirkland)
		* bastardised native (show BabaKiueria from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUMpPgMGCe8&feature=youtu.be&t=80 until the title screen, ~30 seconds)
3. British place names are a combination of these, because the country's been colonised over and over again, but not so recently.  The native ones seem so straightforward because we get them in one language, while Britain's have an accretion of languages: celtic, Latin, anglo-saxon, viking, French
		* show Derwent/Avon map
4. So that's how we ended up with names like (1 photo each):
		* Chipping Campden
		* Ebrington
		* Paxford
		* Aston Magna
		* Moreton-in-Marsh
	All of which are within a few miles of each other, because we hiked them all in a day.
5. That hike got me thinking about Janelle Shane's "Letting Neural Networks Be Weird"
		* Show an example - maybe ice cream flavours?
